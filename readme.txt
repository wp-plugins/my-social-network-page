This plugin allows you to integrate your twitter, and last.fm account into a page, or an article on your blog.

== Description ==

This plugin allowed you to integrate your twitter and last.fm account into a page, or an article on your blog. It prints on the page / article your X lasts tweet. Links, hashtags and @username are converted into links. There is a cache system, which refresh every 60 seconds.

To use it on one of your page / article, you need to write : *[twitter username=YOURUSERNAME limit=LIMIT]* or *[lastfm username=YOURUSERNAME limit=LIMIT]

ex : your username is MagicMicky, and you want to show up 5 tweets so, in your page you write :* "[twitter username=MagicMicky limit=5]"*

If you want to personalize the results, there is a css file into the folder. The css contains predefined class. You should edit it for a better integration in your theme.

In the next few weeks, I want this plugin to display your youtube, dailymotion, flickr facebook, and other social networks informations.
